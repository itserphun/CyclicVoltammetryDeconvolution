# CyclicVoltammetryDeconvolution
Description
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a multifaceted and essential tool in material science and electrochemistry, providing insights into the redox behavior of materials. This test can be applied to a wide range of materials in diverse applications involving the electron-transfer process. In CV, the working electrode's potential is varied stepwise between two predetermined values, and the response current is recorded. During the negative potential scanning, all species at the electrode interface undergo reduction, resulting in the recording of a cathodic current. Conversely, when the potential is positively swept, the oxidation of these species produces an anodic current. The reiteration of these cycles will be continued until reach a cyclical steady state.Since most of the systems are complex and often include multiple redox reactions simultaneously, resulting in overlapped peaks. We need to accurately separate these from each other to examine the electron transfer-initiated chemical reactions in more detail.
